# testing-infrastructure Specification Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Vitest Unit Testing Framework
The system SHALL use Vitest for unit and component testing with React Testing Library.

#### Scenario: Unit tests run successfully
- **GIVEN** Vitest is configured
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test`
- **THEN** all test files matching `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` are executed
- **AND** test results are displayed in the terminal
- **AND** the process exits with appropriate status codes

#### Scenario: Watch mode for TDD
- **GIVEN** Vitest is running in watch mode
- **WHEN** a source file or test file changes
- **THEN** affected tests re-run automatically
- **AND** the developer receives immediate feedback
- **AND** only changed tests run (not the entire suite)

#### Scenario: Test coverage reporting
- **GIVEN** Vitest is configured with coverage
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:coverage`
- **THEN** a coverage report is generated
- **AND** coverage percentages are displayed for files, lines, branches, and functions
- **AND** uncovered lines are highlighted

### Requirement: React Testing Library Integration
The system SHALL use React Testing Library for component testing with accessibility-focused queries.

#### Scenario: Component tests follow best practices
- **GIVEN** React Testing Library is configured
- **WHEN** a developer writes component tests
- **THEN** tests use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText, etc.)
- **AND** tests focus on user behavior, not implementation details
- **AND** tests verify accessibility features

#### Scenario: User interaction testing
- **GIVEN** a component with interactive elements
- **WHEN** tests simulate user actions (click, type, etc.)
- **THEN** the component responds correctly
- **AND** state updates are reflected in the DOM
- **AND** event handlers are called as expected

#### Scenario: Async testing support
- **GIVEN** a component with async operations
- **WHEN** tests wait for async updates
- **THEN** `waitFor`, `findBy*` queries work correctly
- **AND** tests don't have race conditions
- **AND** proper cleanup happens after each test

### Requirement: Playwright E2E Testing Framework
The system SHALL use Playwright for end-to-end testing across browsers.

#### Scenario: E2E tests run in CI/CD
- **GIVEN** Playwright is configured
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:e2e`
- **THEN** tests execute in headless browser mode
- **AND** tests can run in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **AND** screenshots are captured on failures

#### Scenario: E2E tests simulate real user flows
- **GIVEN** a critical user flow is implemented
- **WHEN** E2E tests execute that flow
- **THEN** navigation works correctly
- **AND** form submissions work
- **AND** multi-step processes complete successfully

#### Scenario: Playwright test debugging
- **GIVEN** a failing E2E test
- **WHEN** the developer runs tests in debug mode
- **THEN** the browser opens in headed mode
- **AND** the developer can step through test actions
- **AND** the Playwright Inspector is available

### Requirement: Test Utilities and Helpers
The system SHALL provide utility functions and test helpers for common testing scenarios.

#### Scenario: Custom render function with providers
- **GIVEN** a custom `render` function is created
- **WHEN** components are tested
- **THEN** the render function wraps components with necessary providers
- **AND** common setup is reusable across tests
- **AND** test code remains clean and DRY

#### Scenario: Mock data factories
- **GIVEN** test data is needed
- **WHEN** tests use data factory functions
- **THEN** realistic mock data is generated consistently
- **AND** factories support overriding specific fields
- **AND** tests remain readable and maintainable

### Requirement: Continuous Integration Support
The system SHALL configure testing for CI/CD pipelines.

#### Scenario: Tests run in CI without manual setup
- **GIVEN** tests are pushed to a CI environment
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** dependencies install correctly
- **AND** unit tests execute successfully
- **AND** E2E tests run in headless mode
- **AND** test results are reported clearly

#### Scenario: Parallel test execution
- **GIVEN** a large test suite
- **WHEN** tests run in CI
- **THEN** tests execute in parallel for faster results
- **AND** test isolation is maintained
- **AND** flaky tests are identified and logged

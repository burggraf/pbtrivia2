# component-library Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change scaffold-react-frontend. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: shadcn/ui Configuration
The system SHALL integrate shadcn/ui for accessible, customizable UI components.

#### Scenario: shadcn/ui CLI is initialized
- **GIVEN** the React project is scaffolded
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npx shadcn@latest init`
- **THEN** shadcn/ui configuration files are created
- **AND** the `components.json` config file is generated
- **AND** the `lib/utils.ts` utility file is created
- **AND** component installation instructions are documented

#### Scenario: Example component is installed and works
- **GIVEN** shadcn/ui is configured
- **WHEN** the developer installs a Button component via `npx shadcn@latest add button`
- **THEN** the Button component is added to `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- **AND** the component can be imported and used in the app
- **AND** the component renders with proper Tailwind styling
- **AND** the component is fully accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes)

#### Scenario: Component customization works
- **GIVEN** a shadcn/ui component is installed
- **WHEN** the developer modifies the component's source code
- **THEN** changes are reflected in the application
- **AND** the component retains its accessibility features
- **AND** TypeScript types remain correct

### Requirement: Utility Functions
The system SHALL provide utility functions for component styling and class name merging.

#### Scenario: cn utility merges classes correctly
- **GIVEN** the `lib/utils.ts` file contains the `cn` function
- **WHEN** the developer uses `cn("class1", "class2", condition && "class3")`
- **THEN** classes are merged correctly with Tailwind class precedence
- **AND** conditional classes are applied based on boolean values
- **AND** conflicting Tailwind classes are resolved properly

### Requirement: Icon System
The system SHALL integrate Lucide React for consistent iconography.

#### Scenario: Icons are available for use
- **GIVEN** Lucide React is installed
- **WHEN** the developer imports an icon (e.g., `import { Users } from "lucide-react"`)
- **THEN** the icon renders correctly in the component
- **AND** icon size and color can be customized via props
- **AND** icons are accessible (proper ARIA attributes)

#### Scenario: Icons work with Tailwind utilities
- **GIVEN** a Lucide icon is used in a component
- **WHEN** Tailwind classes are applied to the icon
- **THEN** the icon respects size, color, and spacing utilities
- **AND** responsive utilities work correctly

### Requirement: Component Accessibility
The system SHALL ensure all UI components meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.

#### Scenario: Keyboard navigation works
- **GIVEN** interactive components are rendered
- **WHEN** a user navigates using the keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- **THEN** all interactive elements are reachable
- **AND** focus indicators are visible
- **AND** components respond to keyboard events appropriately

#### Scenario: Screen reader compatibility
- **GIVEN** shadcn/ui components are used
- **WHEN** a screen reader user interacts with the application
- **THEN** all components have appropriate ARIA labels and roles
- **AND** state changes are announced properly
- **AND** form controls have associated labels

### Requirement: Component Documentation
The system SHALL include examples and documentation for using shadcn/ui components.

#### Scenario: Example components are documented
- **GIVEN** shadcn/ui is integrated
- **WHEN** a developer views the project documentation
- **THEN** examples show how to install and use components
- **AND** customization instructions are clear
- **AND** accessibility considerations are documented

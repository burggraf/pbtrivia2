- **GIVEN** PostCSS is configured with Tailwind plugin
- **WHEN** CSS files include `@tailwind` directives
- **THEN** Tailwind utilities are generated correctly

### Requirement: Production CSS Optimization
The system SHALL optimize CSS for production builds.

#### Scenario: Unused CSS is purged
- **GIVEN** Tailwind CSS is configured for production
- **WHEN** `npm run build` is executed
- **THEN** unused utility classes are removed from the final CSS
- **AND** the CSS file size is minimized

#### Scenario: CSS is minified

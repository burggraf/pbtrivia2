# build-system Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change scaffold-react-frontend. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Vite Build Configuration
The system SHALL use Vite as the build tool with React plugin for development and production builds.

#### Scenario: Development server starts successfully
- **GIVEN** the project is scaffolded
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run dev`
- **THEN** a development server starts at `http://localhost:5173`
- **AND** hot module replacement (HMR) is enabled
- **AND** the React app is accessible in the browser

#### Scenario: Production build creates optimized assets
- **GIVEN** the project is scaffolded
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run build`
- **THEN** optimized static assets are created in the `dist/` directory
- **AND** JavaScript bundles are minified and tree-shaken
- **AND** CSS is extracted and minified
- **AND** assets include content-based hashes for cache busting

#### Scenario: Build preview works locally
- **GIVEN** a production build has been created
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run preview`
- **THEN** a local server serves the production build
- **AND** the application functions correctly in production mode

### Requirement: TypeScript Configuration
The system SHALL use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

#### Scenario: TypeScript compilation passes
- **GIVEN** TypeScript is configured
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run build`
- **THEN** TypeScript compilation completes without errors

### Requirement: Package Management
The system SHALL use npm for dependency management with a properly configured `package.json`.

#### Scenario: Dependencies install cleanly

### Requirement: Development Environment Configuration
The system SHALL include configuration files for consistent development experience.

#### Scenario: ESLint catches code quality issues
- **GIVEN** ESLint is configured
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run lint`
- **THEN** code quality issues are reported
